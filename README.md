# rrfun
This is a creation of my own that will contain a certain amount of amusing functionnalities.
I am having fun trying to bring forward this program to you in a few different langages that are:
- c
- python
- javascript
- (maybye) bash [apple and linux]
- (maybye) .bat [windows only]

# This is the initial post of this readme because it was what inspired me in creating this program.
