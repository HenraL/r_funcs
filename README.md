# rrfun
This is a creation of my own that will contain a certain amount of amusing functionnalities.
I am having fun trying to bring forward this program to you in a few different langages that are:
- c
- python
- javascript
- (maybye) bash [apple and linux]
- (maybye) .bat [windows only]

If you have any suggestions of ideas to implement, post them in the comunity section or on reddit [r/rrfun](https://www.reddit.com/r/rrfun/).

# This is the initial post of this readme because it was what inspired me in creating this program.

# r_pv
This is a recreation of the function pv that is available in the shell. I had fun making the logic of the program in different languages, these langages are: c, python, javascript, bash, and mabye other langages later.
